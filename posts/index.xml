      <description>The Professional Cloud Developer exam covers a large, possibly unbounded, amount of content. These notes seek to encapsulate, or at least link out to, everything examinable.
The notes have a grey background, and each correspond to one of the ninity-one dot-points in the GCP Professional Cloud Developer Study Guide.
Everything&amp;rsquo;s been sourced from A Cloud Guru, Google Cloud Training on Coursera or the Google Cloud Docs themselves.

      <description>Try it in CodeSandbox! ✏️️
The problem Material UI&amp;rsquo;s drawer component is an animated sidebar. You can use it as a navigation bar or side sheet.
By default, the drawer is position: fixed, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s removed from the document flow and positioned relative to the viewport. This causes two issues:
 The drawer is always stuck to the side of the screen The drawer doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect the position of the content around it.</description>
